2023.4.6 -- Added more unit conversions to support Buckingham potentials
  * added e.g. eV*Å^6 to kcal/mol*Å^6 to support Buckingham pontetials
    
2023.2.28 -- Added a compact JSON encoder
  * To make the schema-type JSON more human-readable.
    
2022.11.3 -- More conversions involving substance (mol) to number
  * Added energy/mol/Å^2 --> energy/Å^2 for force constants
  * Added energy/mol/Å^3 --> energy/Å^3 for stress/pressure/elastic constants

0.1.0 (2017-12-07)
  * First release on PyPI.
